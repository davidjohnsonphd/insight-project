# Insight Dashboard: A/B Test Tracker

A dashboard built as a consulting project for Insight. The dashboard allows Insight to track the effectiveness of its campaigns on increasing applicant conversion rates in real time.

The dashboard is the front-end of a complete A/B testing pipeline.  

Information about applicants who have started and/or finished their application is pulled from several databases. The program randomly assigns unfinished applicants to receive different email campaigns and stores the assigned campaign information.

Once the email campaigns are underway the dashboard pulls in information about what campaign was assigned to each applicant as well as who completed their application and when. The dashboard tracks this information for any number of campaigns that may be running in a given applicant cycle.

The output is an interactive dashboard that is updated daily. It reports the completed application rate for each campaign and calculates the amount of applicant lift relative to a control group.

Please note that because this is an ongoing consulting project, simulated data are reported.
